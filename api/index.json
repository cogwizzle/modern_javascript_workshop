Although, JavaScript offers Promises, Event Emitter or Callbacks to solve the very same purpose, but each has its drawbacks. To handle such asynchronous data streams, we need Reactive Programming. One of the popular feature that has gained a lot of traction in Angular community for handling asynchronous requests, events or data is \u2018Observables\u2019. Observables open up a continuous channel of communication in which multiple values of data can be emitted over time.\r\nIn this talk we will discuss about Observables, its types and how it is different than \u2018Promises\u2019. In addition, the real power of Observables is exhibited by its operators that allows transforming, combining, manipulating, and working with the sequences of items emitted. We will be discussing various operators using RxJS (Reactive Extension of JavaScript), popular library in Angular v2 or higher frameworks for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.\r\n\r\n",
